	abstract = {Stress is a major concern in daily life, as it imposes significant and growing health and economic costs on society every year. Stress and driving are a dangerous combination and can lead to life-threatening situations, evidenced by the large number of road traffic crashes that occur every year due to driver stress. In addition, the rate of general health issues caused by work-related chronic stress in drivers who work in public and private transport is greater than in many other occupational groups. An in-vehicle warning system for driver stress levels is needed to continuously predict dangerous driving situations and proactively alert drivers to ensure safe and comfortable driving. As a result of the recent developments in ambient intelligence, such as sensing technologies, pervasive devices, context recognition, and communications, driver stress can be automatically detected using multimodal measurements. This critical review investigates the state of the art of techniques and achievements for automatic driver stress level detection based on multimodal sensors and data. In this work, the most widely used data followed by frequent and highly performed selected features to detect driver stress levels are analyzed and presented. This review also discusses key methodological issues and gaps that hinder the implementation of driver stress detection systems and offers insights into future research directions.},

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization. It also acts as a regularizer, in some cases eliminating the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.9\% top-5 validation error (and 4.8\% test error), exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

            In the last few years, the deep learning (DL) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning (ML) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications. Computational tools including FPGA, GPU, and CPU are summarized along with a description of their influence on DL. The paper ends with the evolution matrix, benchmark datasets, and summary and conclusion.},

To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing.

	abstract = {Stress is a complex issue with wide-ranging physical and psychological impacts on human daily performance. Specifically, acute stress detection is becoming a valuable application in contextual human understanding. Two common approaches to training a stress detection model are subject-dependent and subject-independent training methods. Although subject-dependent training methods have proven to be the most accurate approach to build stress detection models, subject-independent models are a more practical and cost-efficient method, as they allow for the deployment of stress level detection and management systems in consumer-grade wearable devices without requiring training data for the end-user. To improve the performance of subject-independent stress detection models, in this paper, we introduce a stress-related bio-signal processing pipeline with a simple neural network architecture using statistical features extracted from multimodal contextual sensing sources including Electrodermal Activity (EDA), Blood Volume Pulse (BVP), and Skin Temperature (ST) captured from a consumer-grade wearable device. Using our proposed model architecture, we compare the accuracy between stress detection models that use measures from each individual signal source, and one model employing the fusion of multiple sensor sources. Extensive experiments on the publicly available WESAD dataset demonstrate that our proposed model outperforms conventional methods as well as providing 1.63\% higher mean accuracy score compared to the state-of-the-art model while maintaining a low standard deviation. Our experiments also show that combining features from multiple sources produce more accurate predictions than using only one sensor source individually.},

              Background
              Over 70\% of Americans regularly experience stress. Chronic stress results in cancer, cardiovascular disease, depression, and diabetes, and thus is deeply detrimental to physiological health and psychological wellbeing. Developing robust methods for the rapid and accurate detection of human stress is of paramount importance.
            
            
              Methods
              Prior research has shown that analyzing physiological signals is a reliable predictor of stress. Such signals are collected from sensors that are attached to the human body. Researchers have attempted to detect stress by using traditional machine learning methods to analyze physiological signals. Results, ranging between 50 and 90\% accuracy, have been mixed. A limitation of traditional machine learning algorithms is the requirement for hand-crafted features. Accuracy decreases if features are misidentified. To address this deficiency, we developed two deep neural networks: a 1-dimensional (1D) convolutional neural network and a multilayer perceptron neural network. Deep neural networks do not require hand-crafted features but instead extract features from raw data through the layers of the neural networks. The deep neural networks analyzed physiological data collected from chest-worn and wrist-worn sensors to perform two tasks. We tailored each neural network to analyze data from either the chest-worn (1D convolutional neural network) or wrist-worn (multilayer perceptron neural network) sensors. The first task was binary classification for stress detection, in which the networks differentiated between stressed and non-stressed states. The second task was 3-class classification for emotion classification, in which the networks differentiated between baseline, stressed, and amused states. The networks were trained and tested on publicly available data collected in previous studies.
            
            
              Results
              The deep convolutional neural network achieved 99.80\% and 99.55\% accuracy rates for binary and 3-class classification, respectively. The deep multilayer perceptron neural network achieved 99.65\% and 98.38\% accuracy rates for binary and 3-class classification, respectively. The networks’ performance exhibited a significant improvement over past methods that analyzed physiological signals for both binary stress detection and 3-class emotion classification.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We demonstrated the potential of deep neural networks for developing robust, continuous, and noninvasive methods for stress detection and emotion classification, with the end goal of improving the quality of life.},

	abstract = {Mental stress is known as a prime factor in road crashes. The devastation of these crashes often results in damage to humans, vehicles, and infrastructure. Likewise, persistent mental stress could lead to the development of mental, cardiovascular, and abdominal disorders. Preceding research in this domain mostly focuses on feature engineering and conventional machine learning approaches. These approaches recognize different levels of stress based on handcrafted features extracted from various modalities including physiological, physical, and contextual data. Acquiring good quality features from these modalities using feature engineering is often a difficult job. Recent developments in the form of deep learning (DL) algorithms have relieved feature engineering by automatically extracting and learning resilient features. This paper proposes different CNN and CNN-LSTSM-based fusion models using physiological signals (SRAD dataset) and multimodal data (AffectiveROAD dataset) for the driver’s two and three stress levels. The fuzzy EDAS (evaluation based on distance from average solution) approach is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed models based on different classification metrics (accuracy, recall, precision, F-score, and specificity). Fuzzy EDAS performance estimation shows that the proposed CNN and hybrid CNN-LSTM models achieved the first ranks based on the fusion of BH, E4-Left (E4-L), and E4-Right (E4-R). Results showed the significance of multimodal data for designing an accurate and trustworthy stress recognition diagnosing model for real-world driving conditions. The proposed model can also be used for the diagnosis of the stress level of a subject during other daily life activities.},

The article is based on publicly open dataset called AffectiveROAD, which contains data gathered using Empatica E4 sensor and unlike most of the other stress detection datasets, it contains continuous target variables. The used classification model is Random Forest and the regression model is Bagged tree based ensemble. Based on experiments, regression models outperform classification models, when classifying observations as stressed or not-stressed. The best user-independent results are obtained using a combination of blood volume pulse and skin temperature features, and using these the average balanced accuracy was 74.1\% with classification model and 82.3\% using regression model. In addition, regression models can be used to estimate the level of the stress. Moreover, the results based on models trained using personal data are not encouraging showing that biosignals have a lot of variation not only between the study subjects but also between the session gathered from the same person. On the other hand, it is shown that with subject-wise feature selection for user-independent model, it is possible to improve recognition models more than by using personal training data to build personal models. In fact, it is shown that with subject-wise feature selection, the average detection rate can be improved as much as 4\%-units, and it is especially useful to reduce the variance in the recognition rates between the study subjects.},

	abstract = {Affective states have a critical role in driving performance and safety. They can degrade driver situation awareness and negatively impact cognitive processes, severely diminishing road safety. Therefore, detecting and assessing drivers' affective states is crucial in order to help improve the driving experience, and increase safety, comfort and well-being. Recent advances in affective computing have enabled the detection of such states. This may lead to empathic automotive user interfaces that account for the driver's emotional state and influence the driver in order to improve safety. In this work, we propose a multiview multi-task machine learning method for the detection of driver's affective states using physiological signals. The proposed approach is able to account for inter-drive variability in physiological responses while enabling interpretability of the learned models, a factor that is especially important in systems deployed in the real world. We evaluate the models on three different datasets containing real-world driving experiences. Our results indicate that accounting for drive-specific differences significantly improves model performance.},

	abstract = {The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make training faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implementation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully connected layers we employed a recently developed regularization method called "dropout" that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3\%, compared to 26.2\% achieved by the second-best entry.},

However, established statistical models such as ETS and ARIMA gain their popularity not only from their high accuracy, but they are also suitable for non-expert users as they are robust, efficient, and automatic. In these areas, RNNs have still a long way to go. We present an extensive empirical study and an open-source software framework of existing RNN architectures for forecasting, that allow us to develop guidelines and best practices for their use. For example, we conclude that RNNs are capable of modelling seasonality directly if the series in the dataset possess homogeneous seasonal patterns, otherwise we recommend a deseasonalization step. Comparisons against ETS and ARIMA demonstrate that the implemented (semi-)automatic RNN models are no silver bullets, but they are competitive alternatives in many situations.},

	abstract = {This paper brings deep learning at the forefront of research into Time Series Classification (TSC). TSC is the area of machine learning tasked with the categorization (or labelling) of time series. The last few decades of work in this area have led to significant progress in the accuracy of classifiers, with the state of the art now represented by the HIVE-COTE algorithm. While extremely accurate, HIVE-COTE cannot be applied to many real-world datasets because of its high training time complexity in O(N2 * T4) for a dataset with N time series of length T. For example, it takes HIVE-COTE more than 8 days to learn from a small dataset with N = 1500 time series of short length T = 46. Meanwhile deep learning has received enormous attention because of its high accuracy and scalability. Recent approaches to deep learning for TSC have been scalable, but less accurate than HIVE-COTE. We introduce InceptionTime - an ensemble of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, inspired by the Inception-v4 architecture. Our experiments show that InceptionTime is on par with HIVE-COTE in terms of accuracy while being much more scalable: not only can it learn from 1,500 time series in one hour but it can also learn from 8M time series in 13 hours, a quantity of data that is fully out of reach of HIVE-COTE.},

These concerning conditions are primarily connected to the driver's low or high arousal levels. In this study, we describe a framework for processing multimodal physiological time-series from wearable sensors during driving and locating points of prominent change in drivers' physiological arousal state. These points of change could potentially indicate events that require just-in-time intervention. We apply time-series segmentation on heart rate and breathing rate measurements and quantify their robustness in capturing change points in electrodermal activity, treated as a reference index for arousal, as well as on self-reported stress ratings, using three public datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that physiological measures are veritable indicators of change points of arousal and perform robustly across an extensive ablation study.},
